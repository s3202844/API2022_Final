                        and then find that all the miracles lie in yourself. With these words, we need to look at this
                        question more carefully:Marx Inadvertently said that all saving, in the final analysis, boils
                        down to saving
                        time. I hope you can also understand this sentence well. Oprah Winfrey once said that you are
                        what you believe in. This can't help but make me think deeply. In life, if the student union
                        will appear, we have to consider the fact that it has appeared. With these questions in mind,
                        let's examine the student union withdrawal. The student union withdraws, what will happen if it
                        happens, and what will happen if it doesn't happen. We have to face a very embarrassing fact,
                        that is, I think, since it is so, generally speaking, under such a difficult choice, I think
                        about it and have trouble sleeping and eating. However, even so, the withdrawal of the student
                        union still represents a certain significance.

                <p class="paragraph"> (Bullshit content) Generally speaking, students will withdraw from
                    the membership, how should it be realized. Now, it is very, very important to solve the problem
                    of student union withdrawal. Therefore, after the above discussion, from this point of view,
                    Russell Baker once mentioned that even if a person has reached the top, he still has to strive
                    for self-improvement. This seems to answer my doubts. We generally believe that if we grasp the
                    key to the problem, everything else will be solved. From this point of view, I think, well, in
                    summary, everyone has to face these problems. When faced with this kind of problem, generally
                    speaking, students will withdraw from the club, what will happen if it happens, and what will
                    happen if it doesn't happen. From this point of view, however, even so, the emergence of the
                    student union withdrawal still represents a certain significance. Under such a difficult choice,

                <p class="paragraph">
                    MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was proposed in the early 1980s to solve the
                    communication problem between electro-acoustic instruments. MIDI is the most extensive music
                    standard format in the arranger world, and it can be called "music notation that computers can
                    understand." It uses digital control signals of notes to record music <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering the importance of this part, we chose a novel research, <a
                        href="https://basicpitch.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Basic Pitch</a>, as the basis of our
                    work <a href="#cite2">[2]</a>. This research was released in conjunction with Spotify's publication
                    at ICASSP 2022. It introduces a lightweight yet powerful Automatic Music Transcription (AMT)
                    model. To train our model, we use three datasets, MTG-QBH, MAESTRO, and MUSDB18 <a
                        href="#cite3">[3-5]</a>. Here are some exciting transcription results for different instruments
                    (including vocals).
